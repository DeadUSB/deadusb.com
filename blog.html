                    <h1>God I Love CSS</h1>
                    <h3>published August 5, 2023</h3>
                    <p>hey there deadusb.COM loyalists!!!!!!</p>
                    <p>and yes you read that right... deadusb.com is now the domain of the site!<br><sup>biggest thanks to <a href="https://github.com/DeadUSB/DeadUSB.github.io/issues/4">karthin</a> for actually buying it</sup></p>
                    <p>now that money has actually been poured into this (kinda ass) website, the quality will increase because it feels like a real responsibility yknow?</p>
                    <h3>and talking about increasing quality...</h3>
                    <p>the site now has vastly better support for mobile<br>but its kinda wip so maybe dont rotate your screen and start lurking<br>or really really shrink the webpage</p>
                    <p>besides that weve got more things on the itinerary:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>1.</b> that blog rework i mentioned</li>
                        <li><b>2.</b> there's a FOOTER now</li>
                        <li><b>3.</b> there's some PADDING now</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>lets dive in once again</p>
                    <h2><b>1.</b> BLOG REWORK</h2>
                    <p>if you read the previous blog post you would know that in topic 3 i mentioned a blog rework, because as of writing this, the blog page is just one after another, which is pretty terrible for a number of reasons.</p>
                    <p>i would be working on this now BUT thanks to the new domain i can host this on a subdomain which means <i>blog.deadusb.com</i> will end up hosting the blog posts.</p>
                    <p>im told that this would take a seperate repo so in the future the blog site and the normal site might look different due to being standalone sites.</p>
                    <p>im very excited for this change so expect something actually good because i really want it to be<br><sup>+ a celebratory cat image</sup></p>

                    <img src="images/blog4_sillycat.jpg" alt="silly cat">

                    <p>might make a trello or something for this blog rework cause i have a lot of ideas and i also wanna show off progress</p>

                    <h2><b>2.</b> FOOTER</h2>
                    <p>scroll to the bottom of the page.  see anything?<br><sup>(you should please tell me you do)</sup></p>
                    <p>yeah thats right, a footer for the site<br>im such an innovator aren't i.</p>
                    <p>as of writing this blogpost (though i hope not for long) it looks like this:</p>

                    <img src="images/blog4_footer.jpg" alr="hey there">

                    <p>ill eventually add something like a contact link or whatever websites usually have down there<br><sup>maybe a webring?</sup></p>
                    <p>this might not actually stay tbh.  not sure how i feel abt a footer for the site</p>

                    <h2><b>3.</b> PADDING</h2>

                    <p>bit of a 2-in-1 here but the site looked kinda stupid panning across the whole device<br>and with a little css and troubleshooting, it looks a LOT better now.</p>
                    <p>by "2-in-1", i am referring to how blogposts are now aligned to the LEFT of the box, which makes everthing look more readable and more professional<br><sub>which is ironic considering this site is far from professional</sub></p>

                    <h2><b>BONUS:</b> I FORGOT THIS IN THE LAST POST</h2>

                    <p>while writing the previous post, mega joined vc and i wanted to include him BUT I FORGOT TO PUT IN THE <i>&ltimg&gt</i> TAG BUT I STILL PUT THE IMAGE IN THE FOLDER SO THERE WAS AN IMAGE LABELLED <i>blog3_himega.jpg</i> AND I PUSHED IT WITHOUT USING IT SO I LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.</p>
                    <p>anyways, after a simple rename the image is now being used in THIS post.<br>(because apart from spelling mistakes and continuity, i am NOT going to tamper with old posts)</p>

                    <h3>anyways that pretty much wraps it up for this post, thanks for reading.</h3>

                    <h1>Improving the Website<br><sup>(working title: FOUND SOMETHING TO DO)</sup></h1>
                    <h3><sub>(also)</sub> published August 3, 2023</h3>
                    <p>hello deadusb.github.io henchmen, got a BIG post for you all to make up for the lull that was the previous post</p>
                    <p>got a few things on the to-do list already which is ironic considering the last blog post talking about how bored i am was like 2 minutes ago</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>1.</b> we are gonna add EMBEDS!!!</li>
                        <li><b>2.</b> removing the '.html'</li>
                        <li><b>3.</b> reorganizing the blog <sub>(soon)</sub></li>
                        <li><b>4.</b> new breakout game <sub>(for a later date)</sub></li>
                        <li><b>5.</b> comments <sub>(for a way way later date (i hope))</sub></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>lets go over what this entails<br><sup>(like a real blog post!)</sup></p>
                    <h2><b>1.</b> EMBEDS</h2>
                    <p>you ever been using discord and paste a link and something appears at the bottom????<br>example:</p>

                    <img src="images/blog3_googleEmbed.jpg" alt="google.com's embed on discord">

                    <p>yeah well this amazing site is MISSING those<br>which is lame</p>

                    <img src="images/blog3_noEmbed.jpg" alt="deadusb.github.io with NO embed (lame)">

                    <p>i decided i wanted one of those<br>but what should i put on it?</p>
                    <p>to figure out what exactly i wanted to do with the rich embed i came up with a few ideas and presented them like this:</p>

                    <img src="images/blog3_ideas.jpg" alt="1.latest blog? 2.simple introduction? 3.zoos music? 4.annoy sppongy?">

                    <p>took some darts and bought a new monitor which led me to realize; why not all of them?<sub> (sorta)</sub></p>
                    <p>you might be saying "but awesome cool mr dadusb? what do you mean all of them?<br>and to that i say <i>Feast Your Eyes</i> on my CONCEPT DRAWINGS!</p>

                    <img src="images/blog3_conceptBlog.png" width="400" height="300"> <img src="images/blog3_conceptIndex.png" width="400" height="300">

                    <p>we will have TWO embeds!  one for the blog specifically, and another for the rest of the site.  <sub>note the blog one was supposed to have the subtext.. my bad</sub></p>
                    <p>alr going in-depth here the blog one will always have the latest post, unless the link is to a specific blog (spoilers for topic 3), and at the bottom, a reminder to sppongy that he cant get a blog up (like the loser pants he is)</p>
                    <p>the normal one, the index, will have a basic introduction, alongside zoos music as a video or something</p>

                    <h3>turns out my vision was too great for discord to handle</h3>

                    <p>jk but seems a bit of a problem has come up<br>turns out discord has exclusive stuff with youtube and such for the embeds (which makes sense tbh)</p>
                    <p>but that means no zoosmusic video/audio playing.  which sucks but instead i talked to mr zoosmusic HIMSELF and added this amazing gif per his request</p>

                    <img src="images/blog3_sillycat.gif" alt="silly cat swimming">

                    <p>anyways ill touch up on this more but so far things are going well.<br>now onto part 2</p>

                    <h2><b>2.</b> REMOVING .HTML</h2>

                    <p>this was actually very easy, thanks to this great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLbYIwrB1Hs">video</a></p>
                    <p>tbh a little too easy i wonder if this is bad practice</p>

                    <h2><b>3.</b> REORGANIZING THE BLOG</h2>

                    <p>ok this is first update that'll come later but basically,<br>imagine a blog that ENDLESSLY SCROLLS.</p>
                    <p>a pretty annoying thing to imagine no?  yeah i thought so too.<br>so basically im going to shrink all the other blog posts and leave the latest one open<br>like this</p>
                    <img src="images/blog3_conceptNewBlog.png" alt="the deadusb website with smaller blog posts">

                    <p>this is really simple so expect this update soon my loves.</p>

                    <h2><b>4.</b> NEW BREAKOUT GAME</h2>

                    <p>ok moving onto the rest of the site since this blog has been hogging up most of the site anyways</p>
                    <p>one of the very first coding programming things i did was make the shit little breakout game thats been featured on every iteration of this site</p>
                    <p>and if you played it you'd agree.<br>doesnt even matter cause i "stole"<sub>(rewrote)</sub> that from some tutorial article that i was learning from</p>
                    <p>in short; it wasnt mine, and i want to feature amazing ORIGINAL content<br><sup>and thanks to the power of Unity2D i can!</sup></p>

                    <img src="images/blog3_breakout.jpg" max-width="1280" height=auto alt="Unity2D with my amazing breakout game in progress">

                    <p>truly amazing no?  its been on hold for 2 weeks already but since im making this post and im not one to dissapoint <sub>(often)</sub> ill get it finished up and on this site PostHaste</p>

                    <h2><b>5.</b> COMMENTS</h2>

                    <p>remember how i said im not one to dissapoint?  you should expect that from this topic.</p>
                    <p>i really really want to do this but theres a chance i am incapable of making something like this cause it requires things such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a backend</li>
                        <li>a user system</li>
                        <li>this is mostly off the top of my head but this is already a lot ok</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>yeah this will come in quite a later time because i need js and maybe php (idk what php is for) + some other stuff idk</p>
                    <p>yeah um thats finally it.  gonna be back in about a week or so for that blog rework<br>time to push this commit and hope everything works</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">THANK YOU ALL FOR READING // LOVE YOU ALL</h2>

                    <p>hello deadusb.github.io fanatics,</p>
                    <p>got another blog post for you all here but this ones gonna be real limited in its contents due to the fact that i have been up to nothing in the recent days</p>
                    <p>ive been wondering what to do with the new laptop i got.  its running arch linux with kde plasma 5<br>and its nice but there isnt really a reason for me to keep using linux as i go into uni</p>
                    <p>ooh talking about uni i actually got my schedule put together nicely since some of the poopy garbage hellish fiends that are the responsible first year students dropped the morning class for calc<br>so that means i got in it</p>
                    <p>also coincidentally i got an email mentioning my electives, which apparently i cannot take as a first year<br>so i need 2 new elective courses. ill figure that out ig</p>
                    <p>feels weird leaving this off without an image so ill add another cat because those are fucking awesome i love cats</p>
